This is the current state of the source code project released for playtesting.

Playtesters should be aware that these files are intended for a plain vanilla 
install of CTP2. It should also be no problem to install over a patched
version of CTP2, or over a previous playtest version.

In theory this version is now compatible with most of the mods, but special
actions may be required to make them work properly.  Please visit the
thread mentioned below and post queries if you desire further information.

Installation instructions:
unzip into your CTP2 dir and play.  If you get warnings about overwriting
existing files then you have unzipped to the correct location.
It might be wise, if you have the space available, to make a copy of
your CTP dir and unzip this into the copy, so that you can preserve an
unchanged copy for playing mods, etc.

Please report any problems, bugs, crashes, etc. in the following threads:

Playtesting would be most useful if it tests the most recent changes, which
are described at the top of ChangeLog.txt
