version 0.01

The AE mod is the combined efforts of the posters at the Apolyton CtP2 sourcecode forum (http://www.apolyton.net/forums/forumdisplay.php?s=&forumid=213) to rebalance, restructure, and generally improve the experience of playing CtP2.

It focuses on neither military, economic, scientific or diplomatic gameplay, but seeks to balance all styles to be equally effective, but to be played in completely different ways to each other.
