[ADVANCE_AGRICULTURE_HISTORICAL]
The discovery of reliable methods for agriculture marked a major turning point in human evolution.  Animal husbandry and breeding increased the strength, supply and utility of livestock.  Early farming methods were subject to the whims of nature, as deviations in seasons and weather patterns could decrease the yield of, or simply wipe out, crops.  Early farmers would farm single pieces of land until fallow, which contributed to long periods of scarcity.  Although starvation was a constant threat, granaries enabled communities to store food through winters, droughts and fallow periods.  Regardless of the risks, farming prompted many cultures to abandon nomadic life and settle in one place.  Grassy lands near major water sources proved ideal.

[ADVANCE_BALLISTICS_HISTORICAL]
Ballistics is the development of mechanical devices that hurl projectiles several times faster than could be attained by throwing.  The most famous of these, the bow and arrow, traces back to prehistoric times, where it was a primary weapon of war and the hunt.  The earliest bows consisted of a thin length of wood fastened with string or sinew at each end.  Later, bows were made of several materials, including wood and horn glued together and reinforced with bands of sinew.  The English longbow, made of wood from the yew tree, was famous in battle, helping win battles over the French at Crecy, Poitiers and Agincourt during the Hundred Years' War.  Other cultures employed the bow in war, hunting and recreational archery, including the Egyptians, Assyrians, Chinese, Goths and Mongols.  Accounts of Renaissance-era European travelers indicate that the bow and arrow was the weapon of choice on virtually every continent.

Ballistae were ancient heavy missile launchers used to hurl large bolts, javelins or heavy balls great distances.  Smaller ballistae, like those in ballista towers, were essentially large crossbows fastened to a mount.  The Roman ballista, by contrast, was an enormous contraption, powered by torsion derived from two thick skeins of twisted cords through which were thrust two separate arms joined at their ends by the cord that propelled the missile.  The largest ballistae could hurl 60-pound weights up to 500 yards, and were devastatingly accurate siege weapons.  The smaller ballistae were better suited to defense against siege weapons and infantry attacks and were often perched high on the towers of towns and castles to rain a variety of projectiles on charging armies.

The introduction of gunpowder gradually made the bow and ballista obsolete, as Western armies rushed to outfit themselves with the more powerful firearms and cannon.  By the late 16th century, firearms had supplanted bows and arrows in all but the Far East, Africa and South America.

Around 3500 BC, Western Europeans discovered that beaten copper repeatedly heated in a fire became less brittle.  Perhaps because tin and copper deposits often occurred together in nature, early metal workers combined the two to form bronze.  This new alloy was strong, light and its raw materials were plentiful.  The Greeks and Spartans found many uses for bronze, most notably for armor and weaponry.  Phalanxes of infantrymen, clad in bronze armor and wielding bronze swords and shields, menaced the armies of the Mediterranean and contributed to the dominance of the Spartan state in the 8th century BC.

[ADVANCE_CONCRETE_HISTORICAL]
Concrete is one of the strongest, cheapest and most durable building materials available.  Its origins date back to the ancient Egyptians, who used lime and gypsum as binders and combined them with clay.  Lime (calcium oxide) continued to be the primary cement-forming agent until the early 19th century, when, in 1824, an English inventor Joseph Aspdin burned and ground together a mixture of limestone and clay.  This mixture, called portland cement, continues to be the dominant cementing agent used in concrete production.  When mixed with water, clay, large and small aggregates and a small amount of air, it is unmatched as building material.

The benefits of concrete are many.  It is castable in almost any form, and is fire resistant, making it ideal for building construction.  Concrete was easier to use than stone or marble because it could be mixed at the building site, and did not require resource-intensive transport operations.  Perhaps the greatest quality of concrete is its superior compression strength ability, supporting 10,000 or more pounds per square inch.  This is far greater than concrete's tensile strength, but with properly designed steel reinforcement, one can build structural elements that are as strong in tension as they are in compression.  Concrete columns built by the Egyptians around 1500 BC still standing in the year 2000 AD are a testament to concretes steadfast durability.

Drama and theater derives from the oral tradition of storytelling, where people told myths, history and instructional stories to younger generations to educate, enlighten and entertain.  The history of drama is as diverse as the myriad cultures of the world.  Greek theater consisted of masked actors speaking their lines on a stage, and was the basis for dramatic productions across the Western world.  Asian theater, by contrast, employed storytelling, dance, music and mime, and incorporated masks, makeup, scenery, costumes, puppets and props.  The focus was generally on the performance itself, whereas in Greek theater it was on the text.

Drama has had many functions:  entertainment, reinforcement of cultural or social order, religious and political education and any combination thereof.  Theaters were often the center of entertainment in a city.  Whether elaborate amphitheaters designed to seat thousands or small, wooden stages set in town squares, theaters, and theatrical performances have been a main source of entertainment in the vast majority of cultures.

[ADVANCE_ELEPHANT_TRAINING_HISTORICAL]
No one knows exactly when elephants were first used in warfare. But it was Alexander's adventure into India that changed elephants from being a regional weapon to one used very widely. Raising and training elephants remained very difficult however, and nations that could get elephants would have a huge advantage. The great Greek king Seleucus traded a large part of his empire for 500 elephants. After Alexander, Carthage found it could get elephants from parts of Africa, and elephants made the famous trek with Hannibal over the Alps to attack Roman Italy.

Later, Knights largely took over their role in Europe, since an armor covered horse served as a different kind of early "tank" and since elephants remained so costly and hard to handle. Elephants remained popular as weapons in their native lands of Africa and India however, until well after the invention of gunpowder.

Humans used horses for a variety of purposes.  More than any other animal, the horse has had a unique, almost partner-oriented relationship with the humans it serves.  It was used to plow fields and bring in the harvest, transport goods and carry passengers.  It followed game and helped track cattle, and, most importantly, carried humans into battle and brought intrepid adventurers and merchants to far-off lands.  Humans used horses for recreation and sport, in the form of jousting, carousels and the sport of riding.

[ADVANCE_MASONRY_HISTORICAL]
Some societies, such as the Egyptians, standardized masonry techniques as early as 4000 BC.  Masonry is divided into two broad categories called rubble and ashlar.  Rubble involves irregular and coarsely jointed quarried and field stones.  Ashlar, by contrast, is made up of cut stones set with fine, close joints.  Some cultures opted to use mortar and other adhesives, but others used "dry masonry."

The limitations of geography and whatever geological conditions prevailed have affected access to masonry materials.  Sandstone, limestone, alabaster, granite and basalt dominate Egyptian architecture as sun-dried and kiln-glazed clay bricks are found in Persian and Assyrian structures.  Masonry became a crucial skill for ancient peoples, and its mastery has enabled civilizations to solve many problems of resource access, national security and city expansion.

Built in the 3rd century BC, the Great Wall of China is one of the wonders of the world.  Winding along 1,500 miles of Northern China from the Gansu province to the Hebei province, it was designed to protect China from northern nomads and invaders.  Almost all of it is earth and stone faced with brick, an example of the permanency and durability of masonry.

The monarch was usually the absolute ruler, the source of law and of administration.  Feudal societies often thrived within a monarchy.  Monarchy existed in various forms in Asia, Africa, Latin America and Europe.

Throughout world history, the term "philosophy" (from the Greek word philosophia, "love of wisdom") has meant many different things.  It encompassed the pursuit of wisdom, the understanding of the universe as a whole, the examination of morals, values and ethics, and the attempt to promote rationality and clear thinking through the codification of rules governing human thought.  At its core, philosophy was an analysis of the basis for fundamental beliefs and an examination of the expression of such beliefs.  Its pursuit was the mark of an intellectually robust civilization.  It was a reflective pursuit, with no explicitly defined subject matter.  Much like science, it was a mental operation that could be exercised on any area or subject.  Because of this flexibility, philosophy, and its subcategories ethics, logic and metaphysics, formed the basis of rational thought processes that spawned many of the scientific and cultural advances in history.

Besides questioning and explaining man's existence and his relation to earth, early religion educated and socialized, teaching people how to relate to such things as family, work and death.  Rituals often sprung from the major events in life, birth, death, sexual maturity and the changing of seasons.  Cultures established elaborate calendars, marking the cycle of weather and dates of religio-historical relevance.  In ancient Greece, the Oracle at Delphi played a powerful role in the lives of many.  Religious stories and myths became fodder for the creation of educational entertainment.  The desire of humans to understand their place in the world sparked an interest in the universe, leading the way to scientific thought.

The Ramayana was one of the two great classic Sanskrit epic poems of India.  Based on numerous legends, it was probably composed in the third century BC by the great Hindu poet Valmiki.  Although initially a poem, it was also performed as a dramatic work in many Southeast Asian cultures and influenced Asian and Indian culture, art and theater for millennia.

Boats made of animal skin sewn over a skeletal frame of wood or bone were developed and widely used by ancient peoples in Asia, Africa, the British Isles, Europe and the plains of North America from as far back as 16,000 BC.  Well suited to lakes, streams and shallow oceans, these boats were used mainly for fishing and light transport.  Many skin boats were unsuitable for open sea travel, as the violence of the open seas was too much for their frail construction to bear.  They were easy to repair, though, and could be built from a wide range of available materials.  They were preferred by societies who either had limited access to timber to build wooden boats, or lacked the tools necessary to cut and manipulate large timber.

[ADVANCE_SLAVE_LABOR_HISTORICAL]
Slavery was an involuntary labor system in which the workers were deprived of a great deal of personal liberties.  It existed in many ancient societies, but was rare among primitive peoples, such as hunter-gatherer societies, because those societies lacked the social stratification that was essential to slavery's existence.  Primitive societies also lacked the economic surplus necessary to support a slave trade, since one of the aspects of slavery is the notion that slaves are assets by which slave owners prosper.

Although the precise origins of slavery are blurred by the fog of time, the earliest known slavery existed during the Shan dynasty (18th-12th century BC) in China.  Korea had a slave population that ranged from a third to a half of the entire population for most of the millennium between the Silla period and the mid-18th century.  Slavery also existed in ancient India and the Middle East for much of recorded history.  The Vikings often raided other civilizations looking for slaves to trade on the international slave market.  It is theorized that slavery was first invented as a system to make better use of criminals, postulating that they were more useful when put to work instead of being killed or eaten.  Regardless of its origins, slavery continued to occupy a place in almost every major culture well into the 20th century.

The craft of building with stone or clay originated when prehistoric man sought to build more permanent shelters that mimicked the natural caves they used.  These early structures were often constructed without the use of cementing agents or binders, and involved rough or crudely cut stone or bricks.  Stones of various sizes could be erected in rows to provide walls for city defenses as well.  Different stone working techniques developed independent of each other in Sumer and Egypt in 4000 BC.  Ancient Sumerians made up for their lack of access to large stone deposits by building massive ziggurats out of fired clay bricks.  Egyptians hauled huge blocks of limestone over considerable distances to build the Pyramids.

[ADVANCE_THEOLOGY_HISTORICAL]
Theology was the study of dieties, man, the world, salvation and eschatology (or the study of "end" times).  It was a discipline almost exclusively limited to Christianity.  It's origins lie with the Greek philosopher Plato (c.428-c.348 BC), who was the first to put forth theology as a field of study.  Although Plato's concept of theology dealt with Greek, not Christian, myths, the fundamental nature of the study came from him, namely: theology is the attempt of believers of a faith to represent their statements of belief consistently, to logically analyze them out of the fundamentals of their faith and to properly contextualize such statements within nature, history, reason and logic.

A scientific analysis of something as emotionally and ontologically complex as religious faith seemed incongruous to some people.  Nevertheless, theology has served to explicate and reinforce the central tenets of many faiths, and provided the basis for the Theocracy, a government based on religious law.

The origins of tool making can be found in prehistoric times, when early man employed naturally sharp stones to, among other things, dig, hunt and cut animal hides.  The human impulse to fashion useful items out of natural substances, such as stone, wood and bone is what set humans apart from other animals.  Tool making developed over the course of prehistory and was one of the advances that made ancient societies capable of feeding, clothing and defending themselves.  Advances continued, and in 11th millennium BC, Palestinian natives created reaping knives by setting flint blades into primitive handles.  Simple metal working dates back to 4500 BC, in which people fashioned ornamental and utilitarian items out of gold, silver and copper.  By heating and hammering metal, treating and tanning hides and cutting wood into virtually any shape, early civilizations could create a tool for almost all of their needs, from armaments to farming implements.

[ADVANCE_TRADE_HISTORICAL]
The proliferation of trade, internal and abroad, was essential to the economic vitality of many of the ancient empires.  Commerce was no longer limited to the goods within a city or country's own capacity to harvest and manufacture.  Foreign caravans would deliver exotic new foods, fabrics, luxuries and precious items.  Unfortunately, trade was a dangerous endeavor.  Bandits and other hostile forces threatened the livelihood of many merchants.  Contracts, laws and other fruits of jurisprudence helped mitigate the risk.

Trade had political and social ramifications as well.  Nations generally had to be on good terms in order to keep trade routes open.  As a result, consumer demand for foreign goods could powerfully influence a government's motivations to keep peaceful relations with trade partners.  Trade contributed to the international exchange of music, art, culture and science.  It motivated nations to fund the exploration of the world, to seek alternate trade routes and find new cultures and societies with which to exchange goods.

[ADVANCE_WRITING_HISTORICAL]
As ancient societies developed, early humans found a need to visibly represent the language they spoke.  Whether it was to document their history, keep records or facilitate communication, writing's origins were almost certainly borne out of need.  Although the world is full of examples of prehistoric communication, most notably in the form of cave paintings, writing systems did not begin to appear until ancient times.  Writing systems developed in many ways.  Some cultures developed a meaning-based system, with characters and symbols that represented words, acts, and concepts, while others developed sound-based systems, with characters representing syllables or phonemes.  Whether pictographic, ideographic, alphabetic or phonetic, the writing system needed to match the demands of the societies' expressions and communications.  Nevertheless, writing was a giant leap forward in the establishment of history and culture for early societies, leading to a strengthening of social order, jurisprudence and historical preservation.

For several hundred years, the Carthaginians have dominated trade in the Mediterranean, growing rich beyond measure. When Phoenicia was conquered by Persia, the city of Carthage inherited Phoenicia's overseas colonies. The Carthaginians have also inherited Phoenicia's naval skills. Because Carthage has been successfully trading for so long, they lost the desire to fight, and rely on mercenaries to wage their wars. Mostly these wars have been over the island of Sicily, because of its extremely key strategic location. Traditionally, the Carthaginians have held the western side of the island, concentrated at the city of Motya, and the Greeks have held the eastern side, concentrated at Syracuse.

The city of Carthage stands heads and shoulders over all other Carthaginian cities. This massive city, full of wonders and riches, is in a very defensible spot; the most massive city walls in the world make it unconquerable, according to some.

[CONCEPT_CORINTHIANS]
Traditionally, Greece has been made up of numerous city states, always fighting and scheming against each other. In 339 B.C., King Philip of Macedonia defeated the combined armies of Greece in the famous battle of Chaeronaea. Rather than conquer them outright, he forced them to become his allies, creating the Corinthian League. In this way, he thought he could retain their goodwill and cooperation in the upcoming planned war against Persia. In particular he needed the navy of Athens, since the Macedonian navy was so small. He only maintained a few small garrisons of troops to keep watch on the larger cities. It was called the Corinthian League because all the cities would send delegates to Corinth, where decisions would be made by voting. In theory all cities had a say in decision making, but the reality of Philip's military dominance allowed him to control most decisions. When Philip died, most of the Corinthian League instantly rebelled. Your lightning campaign just after Philip's death restored the League, but not before the powerful city of Thebes was destroyed for leading the rebellion.

Now, with Thebes out of the picture, the far and away most important city in the League is Athens. With over 100,000 people, it is probably the second largest city in the known world. However, it has a famous orator by the name of Demosthenes who is constantly trying to rally the people of Greece against you. How to neutralize Demosthenes and the rebellious urges of Athens and the other Corinthian League city states will be one of your biggest problems. 

Because Greece is so overpopulated, they will periodically send Settlers, eager to start new cities in the relatively underpopulated Persian satraps. However, they will only send Settlers as long as they remain your ally. Because of the barbarian threat from the tribes North of Macedonia, it is unwise to attempt settling in this region.

The Corinthian League may defeat the Persian armies or navies on their own, but don't count on it as no recent Greek has shown the military prowess of Philip or yourself.

The only major Greek city within Greece that is not part of the Corinthian League is Sparta, but there are many other ethnically Greek cities outside Greece itself that remain free of Macedonian domination. These other Greek cities are lumped together into the Greek civilization.

[CONCEPT_EMBARGO_GAMEPLAY]
When a player embargoes a nation's <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_TRADE>trade<e>, he or she is cutting off all trade relations with that nation.  The embargoed nation is unable to create <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_TRADE_ROUTE>trade routes<e> with the player's cities, which effectively prevents them from drawing any trade profits from them.  In Call To Power II, players can use the <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_THREAT>threat<e> of embargo as a <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_DIPLOMACY>diplomatic<e> weapon.  Once an embargo is in place, the player can <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_OFFER>offer<e> to end the embargo.  On the other hand, if players find themselves embargoed by another nation, they can <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_REQUEST>request<e> an end to the embargo through diplomatic correspondence.

If a player's empire is too large for the current <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_GOVERNMENTS>Government<e> type, the citizens will become <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_HAPPINESS>Unhappy<e>.

[CONCEPT_FOOD_GAMEPLAY]
Food is one of the fundamental resources of the game.  All <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_CITY>Cities<e> grow and harvest Food by working the tiles of land in and around the city.  The city limits (represented by a white dotted line drawn on the map) indicate from which tiles a city draws Food.  Different terrain types grow varying levels of Food, and <L:DATABASE_TILE_IMPROVEMENTS,TILEIMP_FARMS>Farm<e> <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_TILE_IMPROVEMENTS>Tile Improvements<e> can help a city increase their Food production.  

If a city produces more Food than it consumes, it will store it.  If a city begins consuming more than it can produce, it will draw from any available food stores.  If it depletes its stores, the city will starve and people will die, reducing population.

To control the distribution of Food at the empire level, the player can set the <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_RATIONS>Rations<e> level for each citizen.  The higher the <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_RATIONS>Rations<e> level, the more Food is distributed and the quicker food stores are depleted.  If an empire's Food production cannot support the rations level, it will be automatically decreased.  <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_RATIONS>Rations<e> level has a direct impact on <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_HAPPINESS>Happiness<e>.

[CONCEPT_GOLD_GAMEPLAY]
Gold is the currency of Call to Power II, and one of the key resources in the game.

The most common way to generate Gold in one's <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_CITY>Cities<e> is through Commerce.  Like <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_FOOD>Food<e> or <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_PRODUCTION>Production<e>, <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_COMMERCE>Commerce<e> is one of the three basic elements that a city can extract from tiles within its area of influence.  <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_COMMERCE>Commerce<e> <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_IMPROVEMENTS>Improvements<e>, such as <L:DATABASE_BUILDINGS,IMPROVE_BAZAAR>Bazaar<e>, can also increase the amount of <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_COMMERCE>Commerce<e>, and therefore Gold, a city produces.

Trade is the other common way to produce Gold.  A robust and vibrant web of trade routes can bring in substantial profits.  In <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_DIPLOMACY>Diplomacy<e>, empires can offer or request Gold in exchange for advances, actions and diplomatic favor.

[CONCEPT_GREEKS]
The Greeks represent all the politically independent Greek city states outside the Macedonian dominated Corinthian League. Over the centuries the Greeks established colonies along the coasts of many places, especially Italy. Eventually some of these cities became larger and more powerful than the cities back in the homeland of Greece itself. It is mostly these oversea Greek cities that make up the Greek civ, because distance and especially the ocean has allowed them to remain free from Macedonian control.

The Greek cities of Italy (Syracuse, Messana, Croton, and Tarentum) are dominated by the huge city of Syracuse. In recent years all of these cities have looked to Syracuse for protection, against both the Carthaginians and the aggressive barbarians of Italy. Many have tried to conquer Syracuse, including an all-out effort by Athens fifty years ago, but its natural position makes it nearly unconquerable.

The city of Sparta in Southern Greece is the next part of the Greek civ. Sparta has always been one of the strongest and most contrary of Greek city states. They have always stood apart, since their society is geared for war and little else. Despite their small population they are a military force to be reckoned with, and even King Philip decided to let them be, rather than lose many men trying to subdue them. The rugged country around their town also makes them hard to bring to heel. Chances are they will openly ally with Persia if you stray far from Greece.

The city of Cyrene represents the Greek colonies in north Africa. These colonies only want to be left alone to do business, and so far they've served as a buffer state between Carthage and Persia.

Finally, there are the Greek cities around the Black Sea (Chersonesus, Sinope, Trapezus, and Phasis). These last three used to be controlled by Persia, but have remained free of their grip for several decades. These cities are all threatened by powerful barbarian forces. They would not be in such dangerous locales if it weren't for the tempting natural resources. Generally speaking, these Black Sea colonies are essential to feeding Athens and the other large cities in Greece, because they have bountiful harvests of grain and fish. Athens in particular always faces the danger of having its food supply with these cities cut off. Control them, and you will better control Greece itself.

[CONCEPT_HAPPINESS_GAMEPLAY]
Each city has an individual Happiness rating that indicates how satisfied citizens are with their lives.  The empire-wide Happiness indicator reflects the general disposition of one's empire as a whole.  Wise leaders will maintain the Happiness of their people by providing them with as much <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_FOOD>Food<e>, as short a <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_WORK_HOURS>Workday<e> and as high a <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_WAGES>Wage<e> as possible.  They can increase Happiness with religion and entertainment-oriented <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_IMPROVEMENTS>Improvements<e>.  Other factors, such as war and <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_OVERCROWDING>Population Pollution<e>, or Overcrowding, <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_CITY>Cities<e> also have an impact on Happiness.

The disposition of one's citizens is an important thing to monitor in Call To Power II.  An effective leader strives to act in the best interests of his or her people, and always has their Happiness in mind.  Leaders who do not meet the needs and desires of their people cultivate an embittered, resentful, and even angry populace.  These citizens begin protesting and rioting to express their discontent.  Eventually, if their cries go unanswered, they rise up in <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_REVOLUTION>Revolution<e> and take control of their own destinies.

Improvements do not come without a price.  A city must build them from the pool of available <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_PRODUCTION>Production<e> resources, which determines how long it takes to build.  Once complete, each Improvement has a maintenance cost that is paid in <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_GOLD>Gold<e> from the empire's treasury.

[CONCEPT_INDEPENDENTS]
This civilization does not represent a unified nation in the usual sense, but instead represents all the smaller powers not covered by any of the other civilizations. However, the small powers do have much in common with each other in that they're all on the edge of the centers of civilization, constantly at war with both the bigger powers and the barbarians. 

The only section of this civilization the Macedonians are aware of at the start of the scenario are the Etruscans, in Italy north of the Romans. These are the cities of  Populonia and Clusium. Very little is known of these people except that their land is not politically unified, and they are caught between the Celtic barbarians to the north and the growing power of Rome to the south.

As you discover more of the map, you will find Independent cities scattered all over. One important concentration is in Arabia (the desert lands to the south of Bablyon). There are legends of cities grown rich beyond all reckoning on the spice trade somewhere in southern Arabia, but no one knows exactly where they are, if they exist at all.

When your father King Philip came to power in 359 B.C., Macedonia was little more than the city of Pella and surrounding countryside. In two decades he expanded it greatly, winning over neighboring tribes and kingdoms in marital alliances (he had seven wives) and conquests. But the Macedonian state is still coming together, people are only beginning to call themselves Macedonian over their former tribal identities. The Macedonians are culturally between the highly civilized Greeks to the south and the wild barbarian tribes to the north. This combination of Greek high culture (Alexander was tutored by the great Greek philosopher Aristotle, for example) with barbarian fighting spirit and energy is what makes Macedonia so powerful.

King Philip discovered and has exploited the many mineral resources of Macedonia. This has helped finance his wars of conquest. He also expanded north towards the Danube River, but there are many unconquered wild tribes there that occasionally threaten even your capital city, Pella. To the east and west, alliances have been made with Greek coastal cities. To the south however, the major cities of Greece are restless. Philip defeated them in battle and forced them into a Corinthian League, so they can help him in the war against Persia. But at the first sign of weakness they are likely to rebel. Compared to these great cities, the cities of Macedonia are still small and underdeveloped.

The Magadhan Empire is father east than even the Persians have ever reached. Such far off lands lend themselves easily to wild tales.  For instance, stories of people who shield themselves from the sun with their one giant foot, or monstrous ants that dig for gold, come from this strange land. It is believed that on the far side of India one will find the Circling Sea, marking the eastern edge of the world.

[CONCEPT_MILITARY_READINESS_GAMEPLAY]
The Military Readiness setting determines the support costs of existing units and affects their health ratings.  There are three military readiness states:  At War, On Alert and At Peace.  

When At War, all units are fully trained and ready to fight.  They incur full support costs and have full health (until attacked).
On Alert status has reduced support costs.  Because of this, unit health suffers a decrease, reflecting the lower level of support.
The At Peace setting reduces unit support costs and health even further.  Therefore, although units are cheaper to maintain at lower readiness levels, they are not as equipped for battle.

It takes several turns to change military readiness settings.  Leaders should consider this when planning their military activity.

[CONCEPT_PERSIANS]
The Persian Empire has fallen far from its golden days of Cyrus the Great. While still the largest empire in the history of the world so far, for over a hundred years it has been weakening from within. Heavy handed and corrupt government have prevented the people from developing how the vibrant and growing cities in the Greek parts of the world have. The Persians have spread from their mountain home near the city of Persepolis (today's southern Iran) to conquer many lands from Egypt in the west to India in the east. At first, many conquered peoples welcomed Persia's hands-off style rule. But as taxes increased and control tightened over the decades, more and more rebellions occurred. Egypt has been the most rebellious satrap- a series of rebellions and reconquests over the last hundred years has left it devastated, and Persia latest reconquest was only three years ago. But there is virtually no province that hasn't rebelled in the past few decades, or suffered from civil wars between rival would-be emperors.

The resources of Persia are vast, almost beyond comprehension for the small, poor state of Macedonia. But rather than spend their resources wisely, Persia's emperors have created vast piles of gold that sit in their palaces instead of being spent on projects that benefit the common people. Even worse, Persia's fighting spirit has waned, and its army is made up of mercenaries mostly from Greece and fiercesome barbarian tribes. There are not only barbarians on Persia's borders but also in the mountains and deserts deep within the Persian Empire. It is common knowledge that the hoplites of Greece are far superior to Persia's infantry, but Persia's army is dozens of times larger than any Greek one, yours included.

Darius III is the King of Kings, the Emperor of mighty Persia. All power in Persia flows from the Emperor, so the skills and continuing survival of the Emperor is extremely important. The past decades have seen so many power struggles in Persia that Darius is one of the few surviving members of the royal family. Although Darius is a capable leader, the fact that he comes from a distant branch of the royal family and has only been in power a short time makes Persia especially vulnerable. The removal of the Darius unit could fatally weaken Persia, since no one could easily replace him.

[CONCEPT_PRODUCTION_GAMEPLAY]
Production is one of the three basic resources in Call To Power II.  All <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_CITY>Cities<e> generate Production by working the tiles of land in and around the city.  The city limits (represented by a white dotted line drawn on the map) indicate from which tiles a city draws Production.  Different terrain types have varying levels of Production, and mining <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_TILE_IMPROVEMENTS>Tile Improvements<e> can help a city increase the amount of Production it creates. 

Production represents the combination of human labor, natural resources and raw materials that are required for industry.  Cities draw on their Production to build <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_IMPROVEMENTS>Improvements<e>, <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_UNITS>Units<e> and <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_WONDERS>Wonders<e>.  Cities may increase their Production by building <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_IMPROVEMENTS>Improvements<e> and <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_TILE_IMPROVEMENTS>Tile Improvements<e>.  

In order to build <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_TILE_IMPROVEMENTS>Tile Improvements<e> and <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_TERRAFORM>Terraform<e> tiles, leaders must dedicate a portion of the total Production output of their empire to <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_PUBLIC_WORKS>Public Works<e>.

To control the productivity of an empire, players can set the <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_WORK_HOURS>Workday<e> level for each citizen.  The longer the <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_WORK_HOURS>Workday<e>, the more <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_WORKER>Workers<e> produce.  <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_WORK_HOURS>Workday<e> length has a direct impact on <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_HAPPINESS>Happiness<e>, so it is wise to not overwork one's citizens.

That is why it is important to consider one's actions and the effects on one's reputation.

VICTORY POINTS
Your performance is based on victory points.  You gain these from conquering cities and civilizations, as well as marrying and producing an heir. See the  <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_VICTORY_CONDITIONS>Scenario Victory Conditions<e> entry for a more complete explanation.

VETERAN EFFECT
At the beginning of each turn, every unit who shares the same square as Alexander will gain Veteran status for the rest of that turn.  Alexander, Darius, and all Generals have Veteran status every turn. No other units in the game can become veterans.

NEW UNITS, WONDERS, TECHS, ETC...
There are too many new units, buildings and so on to list here. You can peruse the other sections of the Great Library to learn more about these additions.  In addition, the abilities of some things familiar from the normal game are often changed.  All parts of the game not appropriate to the time period have been removed.

TIME INDEX
Each turn represents one month. Science, Production and Growth have been slowed to accomodate this. Researching a technology is 10 times slower, and tile improvements, units and buildings cost roughly 5 to 10 times more than usual, and cities grow at 1/10th of the usual rate.

See the <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_TERRAIN_RULES>Terrain and Movement Rules<e> and <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_MAJOR_RIVERS>Major Rivers<e> information entries for the numerous and important changes in these areas.

NAVAL UNITS
If your naval units move into foreign waters (i.e. outside your own borders), they will be out of range of their support bases and gradually start to receive damage, until they either move back into your own borders or sink to the bottom of the ocean.

HAPPINESS
Large cities generally have a harder time staying happy in this scenario.  This is represented by City Size Unrest.  But you can counter this effect by building buildings like the Public Bath or the Arena.  The penalty for going over the maximum number of cities allowed per government type is reduced to one fourth.

Settlers cannot be built, and if you disband an existing city, you will receive an Infantry unit instead of a new Settler.  However, from time to time the Corinthian League will give you Settlers if you maintain your alliance with them.  These Settlers create a population 3 city with several improvements already.

EXCLUSIVE PRODUCTION
Some units and buildings can only be built in certain cities. For instance, Elephant Warriors can only be built in Indian cities and Hoplites are only available in ethnically Greek cities.  The exception to this is if you found a new city.  New Cities can build any type of unit.  However, you cannot build Settlers and will only receive them through special events.

[CONCEPT_SUPPORT_COST_GAMEPLAY]
Waging war is not without its price.  When a city builds a unit, the cost of that unit is measured in the <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_PRODUCTION>Production<e> resources it takes to build it.  Once built, however, the unit incurs an additional cost of maintaining its health and training.  This Military Support cost is extracted from the total <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_PRODUCTION>Production<e> output of an empire.  The larger the military, the more strain on <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_PRODUCTION>Production<e> resources it has. 

Several things can affect Military Support costs, including <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_GOVERNMENTS>Government<e> type, <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_WONDERS>Wonders<e> and the <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_MILITARY_READINESS>Military Readiness<e> Setting.

To Threaten another with, for instance, <L:DATABASE_ORDERS,ORDER_ATTACK>Attacking<e> a city, or <L:DATABASE_ORDERS,ORDER_INTERCEPT_TRADE>Pirating<e> their trade routes can run the risk of making them angry.

The cost of Tile Improvements is drawn from the pool of available Public Works resources, which is, in turn, extracted from the total Production output of an empire.  Unlike city <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_IMPROVEMENTS>Improvements<e>, Tile Improvements do not have a maintenance cost, nor can one sell them.

Likewise, players should review the proposals they receive with an ear for Tone.

MAJOR RIVER RULES
In ancient times, large rivers were a great obstacle to travel.  While ships could sail up and down them with ease, crossing them was nearly impossible without a bridge or a ship to carry people across.  This is reflected in this scenario.  Major rivers look no different from other rivers, but virtually all land units can only move across them if there is a road over the river or by boarding a Galley.  Only Horsemen, Warriors, Scouts and Alexander can cross major rivers unaided.  Because they're so difficult to see, here is a list of all the rivers in the game:

DANUBE.  Directly to the north of Macedonia (i.e., north of Pella and Philippolis).  Two branches upstream also cannot be crossed.
GANGES.  In eastern India, flowing through a large irrigated valley.  Several branches also.
INDUS.  In western India, roughly from the city of Taksasila to the city of Pattala.  Including several branches.
NILE.  The main river of Egypt (starting from the town of Pelusium).  Below the city of Syene, a series of waterfalls makes the Nile navigable only occasionally.
OXUS.  The main river of Sogdia, running near Baktra and with a branch heading towards Marakanda.
TIGRIS and EUPHRATES.  The twin rivers of Mesopotamia.  Both run very close to the city of Bablyon.  The Tigris heads up towards Arbela, and the Euphrates heads towards Thapsacus.

Please keep these locations in mind. If you are unsure if a tile is part of a major river, right click on the tile, and check to see if the word River is included in the terrain name. You can also recognize major rivers on the minimap: they show up as bright green.

Galleys and Triremes can sail up and down major rivers.  Cities directly on major rivers can build Galleys and Harbors.  All the major rivers rules only apply to the flat, navigable parts of the rivers.  Once the rivers get close to Hills, they function like all other rivers.

VICTORY CONDITIONS
Your performance in this game is rated through a point based objective system. You can earn up to 60 Victory Points in the game. You gain Victory Points for three things:
1) Raise an heir to be old enough to take on the leadership of the Macedonians after your death. After finding a wife and giving birth to a son, you will earn a Victory Point for each year your son lives, up until the son reaches the age of 12, at which point you will get a 5 point bonus.
2) Destroy or ally with civilizations. You get a Victory Point for each civilization in the game you've destroyed or allied with. Note that the Persians and Independent civilizations hate you fiercely and will not ally with you under any circumstances. 
3) Conquer and hold key cities, which include Syracuse, Tarentum, Carthage, Rome, Athens, Corinth, Pella, Sparta, Ephesus, Halicarnassus, Cyene, Memphis, Tyre, Salamis, Thapsacus, Tarsus, Sinope, Babylon, Susa, Ecbatana, Persepolis, Baktra, Aornus, Marakanda, Roruka, Pattala, Taksasila, Sakala, Ujjayini, Suvarnagiri, Kausambi, Mathura, Pataliputra, Tamralipti, Marib and Shabwah.

[CONCEPT_TERRAIN_RULES_GAMEPLAY]
The terrain and movement rules have changed significantly in this game.

- Sand Dune is a new terrain type, as is the Desert Hill.  The Sand Dune represents extreme, impassable deserts.  It looks the same as ordinary Desert, except it lacks the occasional cactus or skull graphic.  On the minimap it shows up yellow. 
- Only Alexander, Scouts, Warriors and Horsemen can travel on Mountain, Desert Mountain, or Sand Dune terrain.
- No unit can travel across Polar Mountain terrain.  These represent the peaks and ridges of extremely high mountains, like those in Tibet.
- Due to the greater detail of the map, unit movement is generally doubled.
- Roads quadruple movement speed on all terrain types except Forest, Hill, Jungle, and Swamp, where it is doubled.  On Mountain, Desert Mountain, Desert Hill and Sand Dune terrain, movement is only one per tile, but without Roads travel would be impossible on these terrain types for most units.
- Many trade goods have been modified to more closely match the important trade goods of the scenario's time and place.  Certain goods are also located on additional terrain types.  Consult the Goods section of the Great Library for more information on which goods were added or removed.
- There is a double production bonus for mines on tiles also containing any mineral trade good (Copper, Gold, Iron, Silver and Gems).

[GOVERNMENT_ANARCHY_HISTORICAL]
Anarchy is the absence of formal government.  Although many philosophers and political thinkers, particularly 19th century French writer Pierre Joseph Proudhon, considered anarchy a viable alternative to government, it was historically regarded as an undesirable state of lawlessness and chaos.  Its advocates considered the so-called natural laws of man to be sufficient to govern a society, but history has shown that anarchy serves only the interests of the strong.  

The vacuum of power that existed in the years following the fall of the Western Roman Empire was a testament to the terrible state of affairs that exists in the absence of a governing body.  The military roamed the countryside commandeering supplies from farms while imperial tax collectors increased their demands.  Farmers, unable to make a living abandoned their fields and went to work for large landholders, eventually becoming serfs, or they turned to robbery.  Germanic tribes settled in these abandoned lands and established power centers.  Romans experienced food shortages for the first time in centuries, trade became dangerous, commerce collapsed and the complex systems that sustained the vast Roman Empire ceased for lack of support.

Theocracies were nations whose religious and state laws were based on the same doctrines.  The separation of the state from the church did not exist.  One of the earliest theocracies rose amidst the chaos after the fall of the Roman Empire, as social institutions, such as education, fell under the aegis of the Roman Catholic church.  Monasteries became the bureaucratic backbone of Europe, handing such things as mail, trade and taxation.  The various "barbarian" states that contributed to the fall of Rome turned to the church for guidance in establishing governments.  Many of them established monarchies ostensibly loyal to the central theocracy, expanding the power of the church even further over time.  In the modern era, some Muslim nations have established theocracies, ruled by supreme religious figures, and where Islamic law governes every aspect of life.

Tyranny was, in many ways, the oldest form of government.  Tyrants derived their power from nothing more than their ability to physically enforce it.  The tyrant was obligated to his or her subjects for the protection, stewardship and welfare of the people.  Tyranny was always one of the most tenuous forms of government.  Since its basis of power was so easily shaken, tyrants generally did not last long.  They could rarely extract any fealty from their subjects, as they often stayed in charge merely for the lack of sufficient forces to overthrow them.  Furthermore, because tyranny relied on the size and power of the military or police force, larger empires became unmanageable and were subject to revolution.

[IMPROVE_ACADEMY_HISTORICAL]
The original ancient Greek Academeia was located on the northwestern periphery of Athens on a piece of property acquired by Plato in 387 BC.  It consisted of an olive grove, park and gymnasium, and was primarily a college of philosophy.  Organized for the worship of the Muses, the Academy instructed young men in mathematics, dialectics and natural science.  Those who attended were of noble birth as the these schools' primary intent was to prepare patrician boys for lives as statesmen.  A scholarch (or headmaster) was elected for life by a majority of the members of the corporate body that organized the school.  Plato himself taught there until the end of his life, and often gave public lectures on diverse subjects.

The Academy went through many changes of philosophy throughout the centuries of its operation.  It was, but for a brief period in which Arcesilaus ran the school, a center of Platonism until AD 529, when the emperor Justinian closed it and all other pagan schools.  The moniker academy also applied not only to Plato's famous institution but to schools of philosophy during the time of the Roman orator and statesman, Marcus Tullius Cicero (106-43 BC).

[IMPROVE_AQUEDUCT_HISTORICAL]
Perhaps the most famous Roman masonry achievement was their system of water-bearing aqueducts.  The vast system that served the capital of the Roman Empire was a feat of engineering.  From 312 BC to 226 AD, Roman engineers built 11 aqueducts, some of which remained in use until modern times, designed to bring water to Rome from as far away as 57 miles.  Contrary to modern belief, only about 30 miles of about 260 miles of aqueducts crossed over valleys on stone arches; most of the system consisted of underground conduits made of stone and terracotta pipe, wood, leather, lead and bronze.  Water flowed by the force of gravity alone and usually went through a series of distribution tanks in the city.  Excess water was not stored, but rather used to flush out Rome's elaborate sewer system and supply the famous fountains.  The Romans constructed aqueducts throughout their empire, and remnants of stone arches in Greece, Italy, France, Spain, North Africa and Asia Minor survived well into modern times.

[IMPROVE_ARENA_HISTORICAL]
The Roman Empire created some of largest, most sophisticate entertainment venues in the ancient age.  Arenas and amphitheatres were designed to suit the specific forms of entertainment that the Romans loved, namely, gladiatorial conflicts and venationes, "animal hunts" involving men hunting exotic beasts or, occasionally, beasts hunting each other.  Originally, this kind of entertainment took place in a city's forum, with wooden stands erected to seat spectators.  One of the first permanent entertainment arenas was at Pompeii.  Built around 80 BC, it accommodated about 20,000 spectators.  Other large arenas were found at Verona and Capua.  The most famous arena, the Colosseum, was in Rome itself.  Remains of more than 75 Roman arenas have been found scattered about the Mediterranean, including ones at Nimes and Arles in France, Pula in Istria (Croatia), Thysdrus (El Djem) in Africa and at Caerleon in Gwent, Wales.

An average-sized arena was about 200 to 300 feet long and about 115 to 200 feet wide, and rose 50 to 95 feet about the ground.  Most had a labyrinthine network of passages, cages and rooms all ingeniously connected with the arena above by trap doors.  A system of elevators and machines were used to hoist animals and stage sets through the doors into the arenas.  Around the main arena, a metal screen-topped high wall rose to the spectator seats, which were divided into several sections.  In the lowest section, or podium, the emperor and his attendants sat in a special box.  On the opposite side of the arena sat consuls, praetors, ambassadors, priest, vestal virgins and other persons of distinction.  The rest of the podium contained senators and those of equestrian rank.  The second gallery accommodated patricians, the third plebeians and the fourth, women, who were seated in boxes.  A large awning could be manipulated to shield spectators from the sun.

Ballistae are massive projectile weapons, fashioned much like a giant crossbow.  They are capable of firing huge bolts of wood, often as large as 5 feet in length, a considerable distance.  Although primarily developed as a siege weapon, ballistae are effective defense weapons, delivering heavy damage to oncoming armies.  Positioned high on the walls of a city, the ballista towers offer offensive bonuses against land-based attackers.

Ballistae were ancient heavy missile launchers used to hurl large bolts, javelins or heavy balls great distances.  Smaller ballistae, like those in ballista towers, were essentially large crossbows fastened to a mount.  The smaller ballistae were better suited to defense against siege weapons and infantry attacks and were often perched high on the towers of towns and castles to rain a variety of projectiles on charging armies.

From the beginning of large organized societies, leaders have had a need for a structure in which the government could reside.  Early capitol buildings were fortresses, housing the treasury, providing protection and, often, a home for the ruler.  The great Assyrian king Sargon II established Dur Sharrukin (Akkadian, meaning "Sargon's Fortress"), a city northeast of Nineveh near the modern Iraqi city of Khorsabad.  The city, enclosed by a wall pierced by seven fortified gates, covered one square mile.  The towering palace included a temple to Nabu (a god of vegetation and the patron saint of the art of writing), a royal palace, and several residences for important officials. With capitols such as these, rulers could impress both subjects as well as rivals, protecting themselves from riot, invasion, and starvation.

From the first iterations of human civilization, nations have always needed protection from interlopers, human or otherwise.  Early settlements utilized their environments to provide security for their communities.  The Anasazi Indians built their homes directly into the face of cliffs for protection, whereas, the Aztecs built their capitol in the center of a lake, accessible only by narrow, and easily defensible, causeways.  By the first millennium BC, many cities, most notably Greek and Roman cities, employed walls comprised of thick stones and bricks.  Gates and guardtowers could regulate traffic in and out of a city, and the walls compelled hostile forces to employ costly siege weapons in order to overtake a city.

[IMPROVE_GRANARY_HISTORICAL]
Although the earliest agriculturalist civilizations existed in the Indus River valley around the 8th millenium BC, it wasn't until the 6th millenium BC that they developed pottery techniques sufficient to enable the construction of storage devices.  At Merhgarh near the Indo-Iranian border, some of the first granaries were built.  They consisted of holes dug into the ground and covered by stone or clay bricks.  They often contained compartments, as well as pots and urns used to store surplus grain.  They were a crucial development in enabling people to settle land and expand their civilizations.  With proper food storage techniques, societies could cope with the unpredictability of weather, soil and natural forces.  Some archaeological excavations suggest that some cultures employed massive granaries of brick, stone and clay, with enough storage space to house food to feed small groups of people for hundreds of days.

The word "theater" derived from the Greek word "theaomai," meaning "to see."

Seating for spectators formed a semi-circle around the orchestra.  It was usually cut into a hillside and featured wooden benches, and, later, stone or marble seats.  The steep layout of some auditoriums enabled as much as 10,000 to 20,000 people to sit reasonably close to the action on stage, as well as enhanced acoustics.  Some theaters employed periaktoi, or revolving panels, to quickly change scenery, as well as a mechane, or crane, which served to fly in the gods (deus ex machina) to provide closure at the end of a tragic play.

Alexander is much more than a unit. In this scenario, you ARE the Alexander unit, and if Alexander dies, you die, and the scenario ends. Many special events occur based on where Alexander goes and what he does. His strengths and abilities are the best in the game, and his mere presence will often cause cities to spontaneously surrender.

Not only is the survival of Alexander paramount, but his health is also vitally important. As time goes on and battle wounds add up, Alexander's maximum hit points go down in a series of steps. In addition, the first time this unit dies, the scenario does not end, but Alexander is reborn in an extremely weakened state. The second death however is final, and it causes the immediate end of the scenario.

Alexander's leadership brings out the best in his men. In this game, all units who move on the same square as Alexander are given the veteran bonus for one turn, or for as long as they remain on that square.
[END]

[UNIT_ALEXANDER_HISTORICAL]
Alexander was born in 356 B.C., the son of King Philip of Macedonia. Philip was a great ruler, singlehandedly creating the Macedonian nation out of semi-civilized tribes on the northern fringes of Greece. He suffered many wounds and fought many battles conquering barbarians and quieting the restless city states of Greece. In the process he turned the Macedonian army into the most organized and elite army in the world. Philip made sure his son Alexander was as well trained as anyone could be in all things. Alexander was personally tutored by Aristotle, one of the most famous thinkers of all time. Even as a teenager Alexander showed remarkable military courage and skill. Once he even dramatically saved his father's life in battle. 

Days before Philip was to start an invasion of the Persian Empire, he was cruelly assassinated. Philip's death left Alexander king at only twenty-one years of age. Alexander spent the first two ruling years of his reign consolidating his power and eliminating enemies. In a series of remarkable military campaigns he proved to all that Alexander was at least the equal of his father Philip in courage, cleverness and charisma.

The rest of Alexander's life (the period covered in this scenario) will only be described briefly. Alexander fought nonstop for nearly ten years in Persia and India, winning every battle. He then came back from his far off frontiers to rest and consolidate his new empire, the largest the world had ever seen. But the many battle wounds and wear and tear of time left Alexander weak, and he died from malaria in 323 B.C. in the city of Bablyon. He died only days before the launching of a new campaign to conquer Arabia. He failed to create an heir (though his wife was pregnant with a boy when he died), and failed to name a successor. As a result, his empire broke into pieces. Alexander died at only 33 years of age. Had he lived longer perhaps his fame would have been even greater and his empire would have survived his death.

Antipater was a highly esteemed general for King Philip of Macedonia. When Alexander succeeded Philip, Antipater remained one of the country's top generals, even though he was already an old man by that time. During Alexander's conquest of Asia, Antipater stayed behind and kept Macedonia and Greece safe from barbarian invasions and internal strife. When Alexander died, Antipater remained in control of Macedonia and Greece until 321 B.C. He then became regent of the entire Macedonian Empire, until he died of old age two years later in 319 B.C. After he died, all pretence of central control died as well, and the Macedonian Empire was divided amongst the most powerful surviving generals.

Though no single civilization can lay claim to its invention, origins of archery can be traced back at least 40,000 years.  The earliest bows consisted of a thin length of wood fastened with string or sinew at each end.  Later, bows were made of several materials, including wood and horn glued together and reinforced with bands of sinew.  The English longbow, made of wood from the yew tree, was famous in battle, helping win battles over the French at Crecy, Poitiers and Agincourt during the Hundred Years' War.  Other cultures employed the bow in war, hunting and recreational archery, including the Egyptians, Assyrians, Chinese, Goths and Mongols.  Accounts of Renaissance-era European travelers indicate that the bow and arrow was the weapon of choice on virtually every continent.

[UNIT_BARBARIAN_LEADER_HISTORICAL]
In the days of Alexander, much of the world was controlled by "barbarians". Generally speaking, they were rough people living a nomadic lifestyle instead of living in cities. Oftentimes the remote mountains and deserts inside a country's political borders were in actuality controlled by barbarians. In the later years of the Persian Empire especially, if you strayed from the few roads or cities you would quickly find yourself in lands raided by the barbarians. Each barbarian group was ruled by a charismatic figure and when that figure died, the barbarians would typically fight amongst themselves until a new leader emerged. In this scenario, the Barbarian Leader units generally stay clear of cities, but they spawn a steady stream of barbarian units as long as they remain alive.

[END]

[UNIT_CARAVAN_HISTORICAL]
In ancient times, merchants, pilgrims and travelers often journeyed together in deserts and hostile regions for mutual protection.  In the deserts of northern Africa and Asia, camels were the most common animal used in caravans, due to its broad appetite, its ability to go without water for several days and its load capacity.  Although camels were harnessed to carts in the tea trade between China and Mongolia, they often carried their loads split in two equal parts and fastened to their backs.  In hot weather or on long journeys, camels typically carried 350 pounds.  On shorter journeys, in cooler climes and in order to evade customs duties, camels often carried as much as 1,000 pounds.

Caravan sizes varied depending on the amount of traffic on the route, the relative safety of the route and the availability of camels.  The largest caravans ever recorded were for special purposes, such as Muslim pilgrimages to Mecca that included over 10,000 camels, or the salt caravans that traversed the Sahara from Taodenni to Timbuktu, which numbered 20,000 camels.  Camels were fastened together with rope passed through nose rings and tied to the saddle, in lines of up to 40 camels.  As many as four strings would travel abreast or the whole caravan traveled in a single-file line.

The timelines of caravan operations depended on the availability of water and food, as well as seasonal considerations.  The Orenburg caravan left Bukhara after the winter snows of Russia melted, and the Basra caravan left Alepo after the rains of late autumn in the Middle East.  A caravan averaged 2 to 3 miles per hour for up to 14 hours a day.  Some locations along well-traveled routes had caravansaries, which had stables and rooms for rest.

Eventually, the increase in sea trade contributed to the decline of many of the major routes (such as the Silk Road from China to the Mediterranean).  Many caravans continued to operate until the 19th century, when rail transport and the abolition of the slave trade spelled the end for the centuries-old form of transport and travel.

[UNIT_CATAPULT_HISTORICAL]
The catapult was the one of the most effective siege weapons used in ancient and medieval warfare.  Although many siege weapons, including ballistae, magonels and trebuchets, fall under the general heading catapult, the term almost always refers to a mounted, single long arm of wood which hurled stones and other objects.  They operated by a sudden release of tension on wooden beams or twisted cords of fibers, usually, gut, sinew or horsehair.  Their primary use was attacking fortresses or cities.  By hurling large rocks, flaming balls or groups of small stones, catapults could severely damage walls, ignite fires and devastate closely ranked foot soldiers and cavalry.  Some catapults were permanently mounted in fortresses and used for defense, while others were set on a wheeled cart for easy transport and positional change.  The introduction of the gunpowder cannon in the 14th century spelled the end of the catapult's use in warfare.

Some regions of the ancient world had great traditions of horsemanship, others did not.

The Cavalry unit represents the inferior horse weaponry of the Greeks. Other civilizations favored firing arrows from a horse more than the Greeks, and so are represented with the Mounted Archer unit.  People living in other climates, such as those living on the open plains or deserts, rode horses constantly and were naturally much more skilled with them. They are represented by the Horseman unit.

[UNIT_DARIUS_HISTORICAL]
Darius III was the King of Kings, the Emperor of mighty Persia. Darius started as the governor of an obscure satrap. But so many people in the royal family were killed in several decades of civil war that Darius eventually came to be one of the few surviving people with royal blood.

He was placed on the throne by the eunuch Bagoas two years before the rise of Alexander, after Bagoas poisoned the previous two Emperors. When Darius proved he was no puppet, Bagoas tried to poison him as well, but after a physical struggle between them Darius forced Bagoas to drink the poison instead. 

When war began between Persia and Macedonia, Darius refused to consider Alexander a serious threat, and did little to fight him. Finally he advanced against him but was defeated in the battle of Issus in 333 B.C. He escaped that battlefield, only to be defeated again in the battle of Gaugamela in 331 B.C. Again he fled, but was killed by his own subordinate Bessus a short time later.

[UNIT_DIPLOMAT_HISTORICAL]
Among the ruins of eastern Mediterranean civilizations lay the roots of diplomacy.  Records detailing treaties between Mesopotamian city-states date from 2850 BC.  The first diplomatic language was Akkadian (Babylonian), serving as an international tongue until Aramaic replaced it.  Archaeologists discovered cuneiform tablets from the 14th century BC documenting a diplomatic correspondence, in Akkadian, between the Egyptian court and a Hittite king.  The full texts of treaties between Ramses II of Egypt and Hittite leaders existed as well.  China had leagues, missions and a system of diplomatic correspondence as early as the 8th century BC, and evidence of sophisticated Indian diplomacy in the 4th century BC implies it developed even earlier.  The Greek system of diplomacy, however, became the model for international diplomacy in much of the West for centuries.

Greek heralds were the first diplomats, protected by the gods with immunity from harm.  Hermes, messenger of the gods and patron god of heralds, was associated with the institution of diplomacy.  Although, as the herald of Zeus, he gained a reputation for being persuasive and eloquent, he was also known as a dishonest knave, a stigma that became associated with diplomats well into modern times.  Heralds were recognized internationally as unassailable, meaning that, even in foreign lands, they were almost never assaulted, imprisoned or otherwise harmed.  To signify their inviolable status, heralds and messengers often carried an emblem, such as a message stick, and were received by their hosts with great ceremony.  Because of this, heralds were often used as contacts between nations at war.  They often preceded small groups of envoys to arrange safe passage.  Envoys, traveling in groups to ensure loyalty, were politically prominent orators dispatched to sway foreign assemblies and leaders.

The Greeks established many diplomatic conventions, including principles of international conduct, diplomatic vocabulary, and international law that survived well into the modern age.  Greek diplomats negotiated truces, treaties, alliances and neutrality, and held conventions, conferences and receptions.  They laid the foundation for a multilateral diplomacy system that evolved and transformed over the next two millenia.

[UNIT_ELEPHANT_WARRIOR_HISTORICAL]
The War Elephant was the tank of the ancient world. The great size of the elephant rendered it nearly invulnerable to attack, especially by armies inexperienced and terrorized when confronted with them. Warriors perched on top could fire arrows or throw spears from a safe position. But elephants could only be raised in certain climates. Only in India and Africa south of the great deserts could one find elephants in large numbers. After Alexander's exploits in India, any nation with nearby elephant herds incorporated them into their armies. Other nations, without the local resources, sought to buy or trade for elephants, which were very expensive.

Hoplites were the extremely disciplined, heavily armed foot soldiers that comprised some of the fiercest and most effective fighting units in ancient Greece and Sparta.  Clad in a bronze helmet, breastplate and greaves and armed with a large shield, a sword and a six-foot long thrusting spear, hoplites fought in a close, shoulder-to-shoulder formation called a phalanx.  Before the hoplite's arrival on the battlefield around the 8th century BC, warfare primarily consisted of individual combat.  Advances in bronze working made new, and heavier, armor and weapons available.  Hoplite phalanxes were typically eight, but sometimes as much as fifty, ranks of soldiers. They would break enemy ranks with their highly compact formation and were considered the best fighters in the Mediterranean.

The Phalanx emerged in Greece in the mid seventh century B.C. and dominated Greek warfare for several centuries. The key to the Phalanx army lay in its organization. Squares of men known as Phalanxes stood shoulder to shoulder, each soldier's large shield protecting his left side and the right side of his neighbor. Phalanx battles tended to be short and relatively non-lethal. By Alexander's time, the Phalanx style of battle formation was widely copied by non-Greek peoples but already replaced by the more advanced Hoplite unit within Greece itself.

In ancient Greece it was common for people to have both male and female partners. Oftentimes, there was a relationship between an older and younger man, with the older man serving as a mentor or father-figure role for the younger one. Hephaestion served as the older partner to Alexander. This relationship made Hephaestion one of the most powerful people in Macedonia, but he proved worthy of the role and became a very skilled general. Eventually he was made the official second in command behind Alexander. In 324 B.C., he died of natural causes, and Alexander deeply mourned his passing. He was given a huge funeral, and there were plans to make his tomb comparable in grandeur to the Pyramids of Egypt, but Alexander died before this idea could be realized.

Indian armies had different strengths and weaknesses than the armies of other nations.

There was no special technological breakthrough for such a weapon, but only very strong men who trained for many years could use a longbow.

[UNIT_PTOLEMY_HISTORICAL]
Ptolemy was a close childhood friend of Alexander's, and many suspected he was also Alexander's half brother - a bastard child born of a liason between King Philip and a mistress. Still very young when Alexander began his conquest of Persia, Ptolemy rose through the ranks and eventually became one of Alexander's best generals. When Alexander died, Ptolemy became ruler of Egypt (323 to 285 B.C.) and founded the Ptolemaic Dynasty there. He helped make Alexandria (founded by Alexander, naturally) into a great city, building inside it both the Great Library and the Lighthouse (later considered one of the Seven Wonders of the World). After his death he was acclaimed as a god by the Egyptians.

A five-tiered warship, the Quinquereme is the master of the seas in the ancient world. Quinqueremes can only move along Beaches and Shallow Water, and the Continental Shelf.

[UNIT_FIRE_TRIREME_HISTORICAL]
The Quinquireme represented several hundred years of naval evolution. Before the eighth century B.C., the Greeks fought with the pentekonter, named for the fifty oars that powered the ship. By the seventh century these single level craft had evolved a second tier of rowers, and by 680 B.C., the first trieres or "three-rower" ships graced the Mediterranean waves. The Trireme dominated the Mediterranean until the advent of even larger and more powerful ships with four and five tiers of rowers. The Quinquireme was expensive and difficult to build, and only cities with an advanced knowledge of warfare at sea were able to build this ship. Other cities, able to   venture out to sea, but without this advanced capability, were only able to build the weaker <L:DATABASE_UNITS,UNIT_CATAMARAN>Trireme<e>.

[UNIT_SETTLER_HISTORICAL]
Since prehistoric times, people often lived a nomadic lifestyle, travelling from place to place, searching for food and shelter.  Some cultures grew weary of this life and opted to settle on fertile ground.  The development of agricultural techniques and tool making made it easier to establish themselves in a single place, grow food, defend their land and harvest resources.  As people formed the first towns and villages and populations grew, small groups would sometimes leave their villages to explore new territory and found new cities.  They sometimes accompanied an army for protection.  Their reasons for striking out on their own were varied: some sought to expand a fledgling nation's borders, some to escape persecution and others desired new or better surroundings.

[END]

[UNIT_SLAVER_HISTORICAL]
Slavery probably have existed since the time of pre-history. It was common practice to enslave defeated armies and cities throughout the ancient world. In a world where human power was the only means of production, it was essential to increase the number of workers without increasing consumption by the same margin. Slavery was never called into question, although some societies had proscriptions against some forms of slavery. For example, Jews forbade the enslavement of other Jews by their own people. They would often band together to ransom slaves out of captivity, especially when the person in question was someone of import, such as a rabbi. Arabs also forbade the enslavement of fellow Muslims, but Christians had no qualms about enlaving any group. 

The Vikings of Northern Europe often raided other countries in order to capture slaves for sale on the open market.  Throughout the ancient world, conquering empires often enslaved the populations of cities they conquered, sending them to their home countries to work.  The international slave trade proliferated in one form or another for much of the first two millenia AD.  The Ottoman Turks gave the Slavic people of central Europe plots of land in exchange for their sons, who were employed in special regiments of the Ottoman armies.  Those "sclavi" ("sclavus," meaning Slavic, the origin of the modern word slave) who survived could return home to their land and live as free men.  Although this was not a forceful slave raid, it was an exchange born out of duress and intense pressure from Ottoman rulers intent on conquering Europe.

While slavery was officially abolished by, first the Spanish and then the English, the United States did not abolish the practice until the mid 19th century. Even though slavery is officially forbidden in most of the world, the slave trade still continues on a smaller scale to this day.

Barbarian warriors were extremely fierce and showed no fear to face battle. However, while they were strong offensively because of their zeal, they were not as strong defensively. They did not understand the element of fortification anywhere near the ability of their civilized adversaries, such as the Romans did. Polybius mentions one battle of the Roman legions against the barbarian tribes of Northern Italy. In this battle, the Romans were horrified to see a huge sea of naked, screaming barbarian men across the field from them. However, when the Roman archers let loose their volleys, the unprotected hordes of unshielded men were cut to pieces and the barbarians were routed.

[WONDER_THE_APPIAN_WAY_HISTORICAL]
The Royal Road was the first and most famous long distance road in history.  It predated the Appian Way by many years, and was much longer than that similarly famous road.  The Royal Road was built around 500 B.C.  It connected the royal residence of Susa in Persia with Sardis in Asia Minor, located near the coast facing Greece.  The road ran over many difficult hills and mountains, linking together Persia's far flung empire.  The total distance of this road was more than 1,500 miles (2,400 km).

The road was called the Royal Road because it was primarily built for servants of the Persian Emperor.  Royal messengers could travel the road's great distance in only nine days, thanks to a system of relays.  The Greek historian Herodotus claimed the messengers were stopped by "neither snow, nor rain, not heat, nor gloom of night."  Normal travel time however, was closer to three months.

[WONDER_ARISTOTLES_LYCEUM_HISTORICAL]
Along with Plato, Aristotle was one of the two greatest Greek intellectual figures.  More than any other thinker, Aristotle had a profound effect on Western philosophy and science that continues well into modern times.  In 335 BC, he founded a school in a grove sacred to Apollo Lyceius.  Aristotle was in the habit of walking around the grove of the Lyceum while lecturing his students.  This earned the school and its students the label of Peripatetics (from the Greek words peri and patein, meaning "around" and "walk," respectively).  The notes for his lectures, later edited by his successors, comprise the bulk of Aristotle's extant writings.

The mobilization of a huge labor force to build the Pyramids was really geared towards showing that Egyptian Pharohs were masters of the Nile and had the power to predict its floods. The power thus gained by the Pharohs enabled them to greatly increase food production through better organization and domination of the peasant.
[END]

[WONDER_PYRAMIDS_HISTORICAL]
Built over a period of 2,700 years, from the beginning of the Old Kingdom to the end of the Ptolemaic Period in Egypt, pyramids were the largest, most elaborate funerary edifices in history.  Built as tombs to honor Egyptian royalty, they were often part of a vast architectural complex that included a mortuary temple and a causeway leading down to a pavilion that was probably connected to the Nile by canal.

Although about 80 royal pyramids have been found in Egypt, the most famous of all pyramids are the three 4th-dynasty (c. 2575-c. 2465 BC) pyramids erected on a rocky plateau on the west bank of the Nile River near Al-Jizah (Giza), northern Egypt.  Of the three, the northernmost, oldest and largest was built for the king Khufu (also known by the Greek name Cheops), the second king of the 4th dynasty.  Known as the Great Pyramid, it is probably the single largest structure ever built on the planet.  The length of each side averages 755 feet at its base and it originally stood more than 480 feet high.  Its sides are all correctly oriented to the four cardinal points of the compass.  The other two pyramids, named for Khafre and Menkaure (in Greek, Chephren and Mykerinus, respectively), the fourth and fifth of the eight kings of the 4th dynasty were smaller.

The Great Pyramid's core was made of yellowish limestone blocks, the outer casing and the inner passages were of finer light-colored limestone, and the interior burial chamber was built of huge blocks of granite. Approximately 2.3 million blocks of stone were cut, transported, and assembled to create the 5,750,000-ton masterpiece of technical skill and engineering ability. The internal walls as well as those few outer-casing stones that still remained in place showed finer joints than any other masonry constructed in ancient Egypt.

[WONDER_RAMAYANA_HISTORICAL]
Together with the Mahabharata, the Ramayana is considered to be the finest example of Sanskrit epic ever created. In seven books and 24,000 couplets, the hermit Valmiki tells of Prince Rama, the seventh incarnation of Vishnu.  Considered to have been written first around 300 BC about events in 4500 BC, the Ramayana, like the Odyssey and the Iliad, is a text meant to entertain and inform. Dances and temple art describing the events of the Ramayana have spread with Hinduism, while the Ramayana itself has survived and thrived through reprints, translations, and dramatic interpretations.
