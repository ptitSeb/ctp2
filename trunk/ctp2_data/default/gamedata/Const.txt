# Modifications from the original Activision code:
#
# - Added MAX_MATCH_LIST_CYCLES
# - Added MIN_TURNS_BETWEEN_REVOLT
# - Set back CARAVAN_COEF devision by 10 is now done inside the executable.
#   - May 7th 2005 Martin Gühmann
# - Implemented Apolyton Pack Values 6-27-2006

# all numbers are integers ranging from 0 to 100

PERCENT_LAND 45 # how much of the world is land (WW from 40)
PERCENT_CONTINENT 70 # how much of the world tends toward big continents verses small islands (WW from 50)
PERCENT_HOMOGENOUS 5  ## how "clumpy" the land terrain is (WW from 55)

# the meridians are normalize on the map at 0 to 100 - 0 is all the way north
# and 100 is all the way south - 50 is the middle  - this works on a map of
# any size

MERIDIANA 1   # north of this is north pole (WW from 5)
MERIDIANB 25  # north of this is north mild
MERIDIANC 35  # north of this is north desert
MERIDIAND 60  # north of this is the equatioral region
MERIDIANE 75  # north of this is south desert (WW from 70)
MERIDIANF 99  # north of this is the south mild, south is the south pole (WW from 95)

# The humidity controls the distribution of forest, jungle, swamp, grass, plains, desert
# tundra and glacier.
# A bump map is randomly generated. The bumps range from 0 to 100. High bumps are
# wet terrain, low bumps are dry terrain. 
# What terrain is used depends on what meridian you are in.

# The height values have a gausian distribution, with middle values being the most
# common. The HLEVEL values should be adjusted to take into account the integral 
# of the gaussian. 

# HLEVELA must be greater the HLEVELB, HLEVELB must be greater then HLEVELC etc

HLEVELA 80  # above this is the wet terrain (WW from 85)
HLEVELB 60	# above this is sort of wet terrain
HLEVELC 40	# below is ??? middle terrain
HLEVELD 20  # below this is dry terrain (WW from 15)

# The wet/dry slider on the custom map screen uses these values.
# The sum of all the wet values together w/ the swamp wet value will add to 100.
# Similarly for the dry values.  Actually, swamp = 100 - (forest + grass + plains + desert).

FORESTWET 19	#WW from 40

GRASSDRY  50	#WW from 30
PLAINSDRY 30	#WW from 50
DESERTDRY  1	#WW from  5
